# autobahnkreuz

An advanced wamp router based on nexus.

## About this project

There are multiple wamp routers available off the shelf, we evaluated many of them
but nothing fitted our requirements, so we decided to create our own router.

The name is deducted from the client libraries such as autobahn.js and autobahn|cpp.

Currently there is a lack of documentation, but we are working to fix this.
